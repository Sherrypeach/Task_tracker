# Overview
This project is a simple **Task Tracker** command-line program written in **Python**. The program allows a user to:
- Add tasks
- List tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Save and load tasks automatically from a local JSON file

I built this software to practice core programming concepts such as **functions**, **lists/dictionaries**, **input validation**, and **file I/O** (saving/loading data).
